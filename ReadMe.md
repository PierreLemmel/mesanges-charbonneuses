# Setup

## VPN

Both computers are connected to the same Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Start Wireguard. The IPs on the VPN are fixed:
- Lionel: 192.168.27.66
- Pierre: 192.168.27.67

## Chataigne

Both Chataigne projets are linked via OSCQuery Protocol

## Ableton OSC

Some OSC messages are sent from an [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) plugin directly to Chataigne

## Troubleshoot

If the name of the file is changed, it can mess up with OSCQuery, cause why not. If OSCQuery is fucked, ask Lionel if he didn't rename the project.
